            "abstractText": "Modern data-driven algorithms trained over enormous datasets have revolutionised contemporary autonomous systems with their accurate predictive power. However, due to technical limitations, it is a challenge to integrate large-scale data from many different and complex sensors. Capturing the confidence of these algorithms also remains a challenge. \n\nIn response to this demand, ShiRAS will develop pioneering approaches that will introduce autonomy at different levels in sensor-driven systems. The main focus is on machine learning methods with quantified uncertainty of the provided solutions. \n\nWithin the field of machine learning, deep learning approaches have resulted in the state-of-the-art accuracy in visual object detection, speech recognition and translation, and many other domains. Deep learning can discover intricate structure in large data sets by using multiple levels of representation, where each level is a higher, more abstract representation of the data. However, a rigorous mathematical framework for uncertainty propagation and update in machine learning models has been largely underexplored. Most current deep learning techniques process the raw data in a deterministic way and do not capture model confidence or trust. Uncertainty can emanate from the noise in the raw data and the parameters of the approach and this impact is a critical part for any predictive system's output.\n \nBy representing the unknown parameters using distributions instead of point estimates and propagating these distributions from the input to the output of the system, we propose promising machine learning methods able to handle uncertainty in a unified way.",
            "potentialImpact": "The project is multidisciplinary and strongly aligned with the EPSRC priorities for a Prosperous Nation, aiming at informed and connected nation. The project will allow two research teams from the UK and USA to collaborate on a highly interdisciplinary area, together with industrial partners such as QinetiQ, Cisco, Valerann Ltd. and other companies. It will enable them to focus on research and to generate scientific innovations that have the potential to make a difference in key areas with strong demands of autonomy - especially in intelligent transport systems and surveillance. The technologies are aimed to be modular and scalable with respect to the time, space and to large volumes of data. The project will achieve holistic impact in three main areas: (i) Academic, (ii) Societal and (iii) Impact on industrial sectors in accordance with the UK governmental overarching strategies.\n\nAs such, ShiRAS will generate considerable impact for a wide range of academic and non-academic beneficiaries, principal amongst whose are:\n\n1) The machine community including academia and industry;\n2) Our collaborating industrial partners, directly and other companies;\n3) The research community, particularly in the areas of engineering; statistics, computer science\n4) The project personnel: the NSF and EPSRC funded postdoctoral researchers\n5) The general public, schools and the society in general.\n\nThe developed technology can be also beneficial for individual users, the general public, for city councils, policy makers and first responders that need different levels of autonomy, and especially for processing the data provided by multiple sensors. \n\nWe will undertake a number of specific activities: \n- Visits of the researchers and staff from the UK and USA partners.\n- Annual workshops to bring together the consortium and wider users group to exchange information and update users on progress.\n- A dedicated web site will be developed to enable access to latest results and progress. Latest news and significant advances will be considered for release to the wider media as appropriate.\n\nFuture exploitation: A successful outcome of the project will lead to new projects both via collaboration with our business partners, via Innovate UK, EPSRC/UKRI and other funding sources. Where appropriate we will seek the advice of our respective Research and Enterprise teams to support the uptake of the technology via Industrial, Knowledge Transfer Network and other follow-on funding initiatives. The project will afford new partnerships to be formed based on the EPSRC funding. Since the partners are actively involved in many external organisations and networks we will be able to link strongly with these organisations to strengthen the research base.\nHence, the outcomes of this project will have broad scientific, social and economic impacts. We expect also the team of this project to generate further collaborative contributions based on this project, at national and international level through the US collaboration. \nOverall, the project results will shape the future of areas of machine learning and Artificial Intelligence, so that the UK-USA collaboration increases and strengthens the world leadership position in these areas.",

            "abstractText": "Teams of robots are expected to revolutionise industry and other other parts of society. However, decision making in such so-called multiagent systems (MASs) under uncertainty is computationally very complex. The decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP) framework facilitates principled formulation of such decision making problems, but currently there are no scalable solution methods that provide guarantees on task performance. To simplify coordination in MASs, agent organisations assign an abstracted, easier problem to each agent. Typically only the most rigid organisations, which completely decouple the agents, have led to clear computational benefits. However, these come at the expense of task performance: full decoupling means that agents can no longer collaborate to divide the workload. \n\nThis project will focus on flexible distributed organisations (FDOs) for Dec-POMDPs, which restrict considered interactions to spatially nearby agents without imposing full decoupling. Currently no scalable decision making methods with guarantees on task performance exist for FDOs: the main goal of the project is to develop such methods along with the theory that supports their formalisation. To accomplish this goal, it will investigate the use of deep learning techniques to learn representations of 'influence' in FDOs and use those representations to develop novel planning methods. If successful, this will provide the proof-of-concept that learned influence representations can enable principled decision making in large-scale MASs. This will be the basis for a larger research program investigating such influence representations for different forms of abstraction and will spark applied research that investigates deployment of the developed algorithms in real robotic teams.",
            "potentialImpact": "This is a relatively short project that pursues basic research in the field of AI. As such, the expected short-term impact will mostly be in the form of knowledge (developed techniques), the scientific output (articles and software) and the influence on research questions picked up by peers (of which citations to those output are an indication). These academic impacts are a crucial link in the pathways to longer-term impact on society and economy. In particular, the project aims to make simulation-based planning dramatically more efficient, and thus more effective or even feasible in cases where it was not before. This could have a great mid-to-long-term impact since the potential of application of these methods is huge; they are advanced versions of model-predictive control (MPC) methods which are widely applied in industry. The recent application of simulation-based planning in the mastering of the game of Go is likely to attract attention in many areas. \n\nAnother reason that simulation-based planning methods have not seen more application yet is their large computational costs. However, this is precisely what we address for the class of problems that admit flexible distributed organizations. For such problems, the proposed research will have a crucial impact in terms of just making it feasible at all to apply simulation-based planning to these domains. For instance, we expect that this could be the case for robotic teams collaborating in future factories or warehouses, but also for other problems that can be modelled as spatial task allocation problems, such as dispatching of emergency vehicles, or for applications areas such as optimizing traffic control by simulating large traffic networks, optimizing routing policies by simulation of communication networks, optimizing UAV patrolling policies in security domains or for law enforcement, etc. \n\nTherefore, a large part of the longer term impact will be of the economic kind (new companies, improved products and services) with, given the possible application areas, the potential to improve quality of life. The first companies to adopt these techniques will be logistics and manufacturing companies since these already are starting to use robotic teams. Many of the other aforementioned applications (UAV patrolling etc.) will probably need more time and are likely to be tackled by AI and robotics start-up companies. The discipline of high-performance computing (HPC) is involved in optimizing both hardware and software, e.g., to make simulations maximally efficient. The basic idea put forth in this proposal---that one can mostly use 'local model simulations' that consider only a small subset of the variables considered in 'full model' simulations, while still converging to the same behaviour---could potentially make an impact on this community, and thus may affect the design of computers dedicated to doing simulations. \n\nI will contribute to the impact of the developed methods by contributing to awareness (interacting with potential industrial partners, as well as with academic peers, and organising a workshop), clarifying potential gains (an expected output of the research), and facilitating adoption by releasing open source software.",

            "abstractText": "Clinicians, patients and policy makers lack access to accurate, real time information on new treatments for treating cancer. This is because such a large amount of information is continuously generated, and it is too complicated to be manually analysed in a timely fashion. This is sometimes referred to as a health 'infodemic'. Information analysed to create clinical evidence (known as systematic reviews) quickly goes out of date, and national bodies responsible for appraising new treatments such as the National Institute for Clinical Excellence are unable to keep up. It is increasingly hard to detect misinformation published within medical literature, and an increasing number of papers have to be withdrawn after publication. INDICATE is a deep learning tool for the autonomous generation of systematic reports and analysis of both structured and unstructured data from published literature on cancer. It has been developed through a collaboration between Imperial College London and Amazon Web Services, NICE and the British Medical Journal (BMJ). The aim is to develop a methodology for the real time analysis of healthcare infodemics that can be used to autonomously create clinical guidance and identify misinformation. This project will build on previous work to develop AI methodologies that automate how we search for medical literature and it will intelligently support peer reviewers as they appraise and assess the quality of research papers. This work has three main goals: 1. To develop a tool for detecting research fraud. 2. To asses if our AI tools can speed up the creation of NICE guidance. 3. To develop autonomous summary reports of clinical evidence of breast cancer treatment that could be used by medical publishers. The study group will work with clinicians, researchers and NICE to define and prioritise critical questions that require answering and to refine the user interface for the system. Moreover, we will prospectively validate the performance of the system to determine the accuracy and performance of its reporting mechanism. The validated data generated by this study will form the basis of a phase II study that scales the number of cancer types and the trial of the technology in a real world clinical environment.",

            "abstractText": "The structure and function of circuits in the brain have inspired many innovations in artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics. New mechanisms for how information is processed in the brain are constantly being discovered, both at the cellular level (how individual neurons, synapses and circuits process input signals received from our senses), and at the cognitive level (how decisions are made and actions planned). A better understanding of these processes, honed over millions of years of evolution, can help us make AI systems more robust and efficient. On the other hand, advances in AI provide neuroscientists with important clues on how the brain may process information and provide powerful new computational tools to add to their arsenal of research techniques. However, because researchers and software developers in these fields often have different objectives and use different terminology, workflows and approaches, there is still a big disconnect between these areas. This makes it extremely difficult for researchers to share and exchange their ideas, their latest findings, and their tools (such as models and software) with each other.\n\nAn example is the variety of approaches being taken to studying and building computer models of vision. Huge progress has been made in Machine Learning (ML) for image recognition and classification using deep convolutional neural networks. Many computational neuroscientists on the other hand investigate vision using spiking neuronal elements arranged in populations inspired by the visual processing pathway of the brain. Cognitive scientists try to understand object recognition and subsequent decision making from a more abstract, higher level. While all of these perspectives are important, they use very different software frameworks and terminology for building models and disseminating their work, limiting how progress in one domain can be readily interpreted and reused in another.\n\nI aim to address this unnecessary disconnection between disciplines in this fellowship. I have extensive experience in computational neuroscience and the development of standards, tools, and infrastructure that enable building, sharing, and reuse of complex, biologically realistic models. I am the main developer of the well established NeuroML exchange format and associated software tools that are used widely by researchers and large scale brain initiatives around the world. To expand the scope of this into related domains, I recently initiated a new international collaboration to develop MDF (Model Description Format). MDF is designed to be a more general format for models across both AI and neuroscience - from complex deep learning models and artificial neural networks, all the way to biologically detailed neuronal models and models of cognition. I will build on my preliminary work in this area to expand the scope of MDF and create associated analysis methods to provide a powerful suite of tools for a wide range of researchers and application developers working with brain-inspired network models. This work will be guided by specific scientific use cases based on my previous research (cortical computation, in-silico emulation of worm behaviour), where widely varying approaches are used by different researchers to examine these complex systems.\n\nAn EPSRC Open Fellowship will provide the resources necessary to develop and expand these technologies while acquiring new scientific and professional skills necessary to lead in this area. The Plus Component is an absolutely crucial part of this, supporting me to actively engage with, and disseminate these approaches to researchers from a wide range of fields, as well as build a diverse community of users and developers around the technologies. Many of the barriers to communicating ideas across AI/ML/neuroscience are related to lack of the underlying software/modelling support, and the work proposed in this fellowship will make significant progress in this area.",

            "abstractText": "AI engines are ubiquitous in our lives: we talk to our mobile phones, ask directions from our sat-navs, and learn new facts and skills with our digital personal assistants. But most of the time, we need to learn how these systems work first: we have to adapt to them as they are not aware of our level of experience, expertise and preferences. AI engines are fast and can deal with a deluge of data much better than us, but they do so in machine-oriented ways, which are often inaccessible and unintelligible to humans. \n\nThe aim of this project is to identify and study how humans \\textit{represent} information that they want to work with and from which they will obtain new knowledge. Humans have the capability to choose the representation that is just right for them to enable them to solve a new problem, and moreover, if the representation needs to be changed, they can spot this and change it. Unlike humans, machines in general have fixed representations and do not have the understanding of the user. For example, sat-nav systems will only give directions with elementary spatial commands or route planning functions, whereas humans give directions in many forms, for instance in terms of landmarks or other geographic features that are based on shared knowledge. \n\nWe want to model in computational systems this inherently human ability to choose or change appropriate representations, and make machines do the same. We want to find out what are the cognitive processes that humans use to select representations, what criteria they use to choose them, and how we can model this ability on machines. Our hypothesis is that when humans choose a representation of a problem, they use cognitive and formal properties of the problem and its representation to make their choice. In this project, we will test this hypothesis by achieving the following goals:\n\n1. Collect a corpus of problems and candidate representations to study and categorise their cognitive and formal properties.\n\n2. Devise coding schemes and conduct cognitive studies to identify cognitive and formal properties that people use in choosing representations. Develop cognitive theories based on these experiments.\n\n3. Design and implement computational algorithms that allow users to choose alternative representations. Build a ranking and recommendation system based on the taxonomy from cognitive studies to suggest appropriate representation given a particular problem and user.\n\n4. Evaluate the utility of the system and generalise the approach to other domains outside of mathematics. Investigate how to apply our cognitive and computational models in education in the form of AI tutors that are adaptable to users.\n\nOur work is novel in that it will address the problem of appropriate representation choice. Moreover, we will build novel cognitive theories and computational models that will allow AI systems to operate in more human-like ways and adapt to the requirements of the problem and the needs of the user. Thus, the potential impact will span numerous domains where systems interact with humans to represent information and use it for extracting new knowledge.",
            "potentialImpact": "&quot;How to (re)represent it?&quot; is an ambitious project where we want to find out how humans choose and also change representation during problem solving. We want to develop engines that will give machines the same capability. Such machines will accrue many of the benefits that humans obtain from changing representation, including: more effective communication with a human by selecting a representation that is well-suited to their level of familiarity with the target topic; better understanding of a human by identifying and adopting the representation that the human favours; and greater flexibility in adapting to the needs of the user. As such, the project will have economic, societal and knowledge impact.\n\nThe impact of this work will be wide as AI systems are becoming ubiquitous. When interacting and exchanging information with humans, developers of such products need to represent information in human understandable ways. We will devise techniques that will help developers of AI systems to build products that choose representations appropriate for their users -- and thus have potential economic benefit to them.\n\nMaking machines more human accessible will also benefit the society at large, in particular, as it will potentially bring technical tools to those that are less technically versed. \n\nWe have already outlined how our work will contribute to the expansion of knowledge in Academic Beneficiaries. The techniques we will develop are novel and will provide a scientific advance in all areas (in academia and in industry) that must represent information for solving problems, reasoning, etc.\n\nWhilst we exposed education as our initial concrete application target, our contributions will be general and could apply across different domains. They will lead to better understanding of representations and their relation to human expertise and preferences. As intelligent tools make part of our every day life, we will all benefit from having more human-like systems that adapt to us, rather than us adapting to them.\n\nTo achieve maximum impact, we will follow a comprehensive dissemination strategy. We will publish our results in all relevant communities (e.g., artificial intelligence, cognitive science, computer science, automated reasoning, diagrams, knowledge representation, human-computer interaction, information visualisation) to achieve wide dissemination. We will demonstrate our work by organising a workshop and preparing tutoring material aimed at academic as well as more specific industrial communities. This will also provide a community building opportunity for people interested in representations and more generally, human-like computing. We will continue to participate at outreach activities to raise the awareness of the importance of human-like computing. We will create a web repository to enable free and public access to our papers, corpus of problems and their solutions, software and tutorials. Finally, we have enlisted an advisory board of experts spanning all areas relevant to this project, and coming from academia and industry - their advice will help us stay focused on relevant problems, influence diverse communities that they lead, and transfer our technology widely.",

            "abstractText": "Predicting unknown quantities is a fundamental part of science andengineering. For example, in medicine one might wish to predict whether aperson has a cancerous tumour or not based on a scan; or in manufacturing, whether an industrial machine is producing faulty devices or not. The field of Artificial Intelligence has studied many techniques to produce good predictors. The last decade of research has seen the development of population-based techniques. Instead of using a single predictor, these build teams of predictors and combine the decisionsof the individuals through a voting or averaging process. Both theory andexperiments show this reliably improves upon using a single predictor --as they say two heads are better than one. A nice feature is that thesemethods are predictor-independent, meaning they can combine any kind ofpredictors (e.g. neural networks, decisions trees) into a team.This project aims to unify two sub-fields of Artificial Intelligence thatdeal with these population-based predictor-independent techniques:Ensemble Methods and Learning Classifier Systems.Ensemble Methods have produced some of the most powerful predictors ofthe last decade; the most well-known is called AdaBoost , and has beendubbed the best off-the-shelf predictor in the world (Professor LeoBreiman, University of California at Berkeley). These methods have beenwidely applied in many areas; however, one important area not yetinvestigated is multi-step problems. These are problems where decisionsin thepast and present can affect what the best decisions in the future willbe---for example choosing to play a certain opening strategy in chessmeans certain moves are less favourable later on in the game. Our mostdifficult multi-step problem will be optimising elevator scheduling tominimise the amount of time between pressing an elevator call button andthe arrival of the elevator. It is surprisingly difficult to optimise themovement of elevators in a large building. For one thing, a building with5 elevators and 30 floors has more possible configurations than thereare grains of sand on all the beaches in the world. Most ensemble methodscannot be directly applied to this kind of problem.Learning Classifier Systems are a class of nature-inspired algorithms, thatcan dynamically generate and adjust sets of predictors, and are capableof tackling these multi-step problems. Traditional ensemble methodshave not considered the multi-step domain, but have strong theoreticalfoundations to build upon. Learning Classifier Systems do not have sucha strong theory base, but have been intensely studied on multi-step problems.This project will create hybrid methods using theory and practice fromthese two quite disparate fields. We will advance the state-of-the-artin both fields and increase research capacity for tackling several problemclasses, focusing in particular on multi-step problems.",

            "abstractText": "GraphNEx will contribute a graph-based framework for developing inherently explainable AI. Unlike current AI systems that utilise complex networks to learn high-dimensional, abstract representations of data, GraphNEx embeds symbolic meaning within AI frameworks. We will combine semantic reasoning over knowledge bases with simple modular learning on new data observations, to adaptively evolve the graphical knowledge base. The core concept is to decompose the monolithic block of highly connected layers of deep learning architectures into many smaller, simpler units. Units perform a precise task with an interpretable output, associating a value or vector to nodes. Nodes will be connected depending on their (learned) similarity, correlation in the data or closeness in some space. We will employ the concepts and tools from graph signal processing and graph machine learning (e.g. Graph Neural Networks) to extrapolate semantic concepts and meaningful relationships from sub-graphs (concepts) within the knowledge base that can be used for semantic reasoning. By enforcing sparsity and domain-specific priors between concepts we will promote human interpretability. The integration of game-based user feedback will ensure that explanations (and therefore core mechanisms of the AI system) are understandable and relevant to humans. We will validate the GraphNEx framework, including both model performance and the performance of the explanations, with two application scenarios in which transparency and trust are critical: System Genetics to assist the discovery of clinically and biologically relevant concepts on large, multimodal genetic and genomic datasets; and Privacy Protection to safeguard personal information from unwanted non-essential inferences from multimedia data (images, video and audio) as well as to support informed consent. These applications, for which understanding the decision process is paramount for acquisition of new knowledge and for trust by the users, will demonstrate the utility of the GraphNEx framework to adapt to contexts where data are heterogeneous, incomplete, noisy and time-varying, providing new inherently explainable AI models, and a means to explain existing AI systems via post-hoc analyses.",

            "abstractText": "Natural Language Processing (NLP) is now critically needed to assist the processing, mining and extraction of knowledge from the rapidly growing literature in the area of biomedicine. In recent years, considerable progress has been made in the development of basic NLP techniques for biomedicine. The current challenge is to improve these techniques with richer and deeper analysis capable of supporting a wide range of real-world tasks. High-quality lexical resources (e.g. accurate and comprehensive lexicons and word classifications) are critically needed for this. Most lexical resources used in current systems are developed manually by linguists. Manual work is extremely costly, and the resulting resources require extensive labour-intensive porting to new (sub-)domains and tasks. Automatic acquisition or updating of lexical information from repositories of un-annotated text (e.g. corpora of biomedical articles) is a more promising avenue to pursue. Since lexical acquisition gathers usage and frequency information directly from relevant data, it can considerably enhance the viability and portability of NLP technology. Research into automatic lexical acquisition is now starting to produce large-scale resources useful for practical NLP tasks. However, the application of such techniques to biomedical texts has been limited because many existing techniques require adaptation before they can perform optimally in this linguistically challenging domain. In this project, we will take existing techniques capable of acquiring basic syntactic-semantic information for verbs from corpus data and will adapt them to the biomedical domain. We will focus on verbal (i) subcategorization frames, (ii) selectional preferences, and (ii) lexical-semantic classes. This information, when tailored to the domain in question, can aid key NLP tasks such as parsing, anaphora resolution, Information Extraction (IE), and question-answering (QA). Building on our pilot studies and expanding on the adaptive, state-of-the-art text processing tools available to us, we will improve existing techniques further and extend them with novel unsupervised and semi-supervised methods capable of supporting efficient domain adaptation. We will evaluate and demonstrate the capabilities of our techniques directly and in the context of practical BIO-NLP tasks. We will use the final version of the system to acquire a substantial lexical database from a biomedical corpus. The resulting resource will be distributed freely to the research community, along with the software which can be used to tune the frequency information stored in the database to particular biomedical sub-domains/tasks.We expect this project to (i) advance BIO-NLP and improve its usefulness for practical tasks in biomedicine, (ii) advance NLP by improving the accuracy, robustness and portability of lexical acquisition to real-world tasks, and (iii) provide an important large-scale study of domain-adaptation in the critical area of lexical acquisition.",

            "abstractText": "For robots to build trustable interactions with users two aspects will be crucial during the next decade. First, the ability to produce explainable decisions combining reasons from all the levels\nof the robotic architecture from low to high level; and second, to be able to effectively communicate such decisions and re-plan according to new user inputs in real-time along with the execution.\n\nCOHERENT will develop a novel framework to combine explanations originated at the different robotic levels into a single explanation. This combination is not unique and may depend on several factors including the step into the action sequence, or the temporal importance of each information source. Robotic tasks are interesting because they entail performing a sequence of actions, and thus the system must be able to deliver these explanations also during the execution of the task, either because the user requested or actively because an unforeseen situation occurs. COHERENT will propose effective evaluation metrics oriented to the special case of explanations in HRI systems. The proposed measures, based on trustworthiness and acceptance, will be defined together with the definition of benchmark tasks that are repeatable and enable the comparison of results across different explainable developments.\n\nWe will demonstrate our framework for hierarchical explanation components through a manipulation task of assisting a human to fold clothes. Cloth manipulation is a very rich example that requires considering bi-manual manipulations, environmental constraints, and perception of textiles for its state estimation. Eventually, the robot can even require the user to help in doing difficult actions by providing relevant information, so interaction opportunities are multiple. We will build on previous results on cloth manipulation to develop explainable machine learning techniques from the perception, learned movements, task planning and interaction layers, based on a novel generic representation, the Cohesion Graph, that is shared across the layers. The COHERENT framework will be integrated into the standard planning system ROSplan to increase its visibility and adoption.",

            "abstractText": "In 2018, the Exascale Computing ALgorithms &amp; Infrastructures for the Benefit of UK Research (ExCALIBUR) programme was proposed by the Met Office, CCFE and EPSRC (on behalf of UKRI). The goal of ExCALIBUR is to redesign high priority computer codes and algorithms, keeping UK research and development at the forefront of high-performance simulation science. The challenge spans many disciplines and as such the programme of research will be delivered through a partnership between the Met Office and UKRI Research Councils. Research software engineers and scientists will work together to future proof the UK against the fast-moving changes in supercomputer designs. This combined scientific expertise will push the boundaries of science across a wide range of fields delivering transformational change at the cutting-edge of scientific supercomputing. DiRAC proposed the inclusion in the ExCALIBUR business case of a request for &pound;4.5M in capital funding over 4.5 years to develop a hardware fore-sighting programme. Industry co-funding for the programme will be sought where possible. \n\nThe &pound;4.5m capital is intended to provide a testbed area that uses pre-commercial equipment for software prototyping and development. It has two main purposes: (1) to enable the software community to be ready to use commercial products effectively as soon as they come on to the market; and (2) to provide the UKRI HPC community with the ability to influence industry and the necessary knowledge to guide their purchase decisions. This will ensure that facilities and the future UK National e-Infrastructure are in a position to maximise value for money by getting the most powerful systems exactly suited to the communities' needs. This double-pronged approach will give UK researchers a competitive advantage internationally. \n\nExCALIBUR will now establish a set of modest-sized, adaptable clusters dedicated solely to this purpose and embedded within established HPC environments. Although small, they need to be of a scale capable of carrying out meaningful performance studies. They are expected to be co-funded with industry partners and will initially require investments of &pound;200k-&pound;300k each, and will allow a range of future hardware to be assessed for its relevance to the delivery of UKRI science and innovation. The pre-commercial equipment will be refreshed and added to on a regular, likely to be annual, basis. This agile tactic is designed to take advantage of the different approaches across industry (some companies, e.g. NVidia tend to have a short (less than 3-month) pre-commercial window while for others this can be up to a year). \n\nExCALIBUR can use the hardware piloting systems to drive software innovation across the UKRI research community. Researchers are rightly reluctant to invest time in code development to take advantage of new hardware which may not be available at scale for several years or may even prove not to have longevity - scientific leadership demands that research funding is used to deliver science results now. In addition and DiRAC and others will offer funded RSE effort to support the development work combined with access to novel technologies within modest-sized systems, Excalibur can lower the bar for engaging with the process of software re-engineering and encourage researchers to make the necessary (modest) investments of their time. In some cases, there may also be the potential for some immediate science outputs by exploiting the proof-of-concept systems. \n\nExcalibur will thus be able to provide an incentive for greater software innovation across the UKRI research communities and help to ensure that when novel technology is included in national services, there are workflows that are already able to exploit it optimally. This will increase productivity across all UKRI computing services and enable UK researchers to use the latest hardware to deliver the largest and most complex calculations, ensuring international leadership.",

            "abstractText": "The current state of the art in decision support and search methodologies tends to focus on bespoke problem specific systems. Indeed, there are many examples of powerful and innovative search methodologies which have been tailored for specific applications and which underpin highly effective decision support systems. Over the last 20 years or so, there has been significant scientific progress in building search methodologies and in tailoring those methodologies (usually through hybridisation with problem specific methods and information) for a very wide range of application areas. Such methodologies can be extremely effective in the hands of an expert but they require specialist human knowledge to be applied effectively in complex real world problem solving environments. The goal of developing automated systems to replace the human expert in this role is only just beginning to be seriously addressed by the scientific community. The challenge of developing systems to intelligently select, evolve and develop search methods is an extremely ambitious and demanding research goal. The level of adventure should not be underestimated. The goal of exploring the boundaries between what is possible and what is not (with respect to the automation of the heuristic design process) represents one of the most important current research challenges to face the search and decision support community. The main aim of this major and far reaching programme of research is to address this challenge by investigating a wide range of promising and adventurous research directions in an integrated and co-ordinated manner. The successful development of automated systems to generate heuristic methods would underpin the next generation of search/optimisation systems that would be able to operate at a fundamentally more general level than current understanding can support. The aim is to develop systems which can operate upon a wider range of problems and problem instances than is possible with today's technology by automatically tailoring heuristics to particular problems and problem instances. Today, this process can only be effectively carried out by human experts.Of course, we know (from the No Free Lunch theorem and related work) that it will not be possible to build a completely general search method. However, we also know (from work carried out by ourselves and others) that it is possible to generate methods that are more general than the current state of the art. The question of how general we can make search systems is very much an open question and it is one that we will explore in this research programme. The emphasis will not follow conventional current thinking by concentrating on the development of systems to solve particular search/optimisation problems. Instead this major scientific undertaking will investigate the possibility of developing adaptive systems which can react to the conditions and the environment of the particular decision support problem in hand. The potential benefits of success in such a radical undertaking are enormous and permeate not only the disciplines of Artificial Intelligence and Operational Research but also the various disciplines that draw on and contribute to them. These include Computer Science, Mathematics, Business, Engineering, Computational Chemistry, Medicine, Architecture (space planning), Bioinformatics, Manufacturing and all areas of Management. The research will also impact upon automated heuristic selection and design across many diverse applications such as scheduling, timetabling, cutting/packing, protein folding, catalyst optimisation, medical decision making and others. This research initiative will enable us to explore risky and unconventional ideas across a range of disciplines and research council remits in a way that is not possible with standard grants and it will allow us to flexibly redirect our efforts across application areas as well as disciplines to explore ideas as they emerge.",

            "abstractText": "Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) have been applied to solve many stationary problems. However, real-world problems are usually more complex and dynamic, where the objective function, decision variables, and environmental parameters may change over time. In this project, we will investigate novel EA approaches to address dynamic optimisation problems (DOPs), a challenging but very important research area. The proposed research has three main aspects: (1) designing and evaluating new EAs for DOPs in collaboration with researchers from Honda Research Institute Europe, (2) theoretically analysing EAs for DOPs, and (3) adapting developed EA approaches to solve dynamic telecommunication optimisation problems. In this project, we will first construct standardised, both discrete and continuous, dynamic test environments based on the concept of problem difficulty, scalability, cyclicity and noise of environments, and standardised performance measures for evaluating EAs for DOPs. Based on the standardised dynamic test and evaluation environment, we will then design and evaluate novel EAs and their hybridisation, e.g., Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs), Genetic Algorithms, Swarm Intelligence and Adaptive Evolutionary Algorithms, for DOPs based on our previous research. A guiding idea here is to improve EA's adaptability to different degrees of environmental change in the genotypic space, be it binary or not. Systematically and adaptively combining dualism-like schemes for significant changes, random immigration-like schemes for medium changes, and general mutation or variation schemes for small changes, is expected to greatly improve EA's performance in different dynamic environments. And memory schemes can be used when the environment involves cyclic changes. In order to better understand the fundamental issues, theoretical analysis of EAs for DOPs will be pursued in this project. We will apply drift analysis and martingale theory as the starting point to analyse the computational time complexity of EAs for DOPs and the dynamic behaviour of EAs for DOPs regarding such properties as tracking error, tracking velocity, and reliability of arriving at optima. Based on the above EA design, experimental evaluation, and formal analysis, we will then develop a generic framework of EAs for DOPs by extracting key techniques/properties of efficient EAs for DOPs and studying the relationship between them and the characteristics of DOPs being solved with respect to the environmental dynamics in the genotypic space. Another key aspect of this project is to apply and adapt developed EAs for general DOPs to solve core dynamic telecommunications problems, e.g., dynamic frequency assignment problems and dynamic call routing problems, in the real world. We will closely collaborate with researchers from British Telecommunications (BT) to extract domain-specific knowledge and model dynamic telecommunication problems using proper mathematical and graph representations. The obtained domain knowledge will be integrated into our EAs for increased efficiency and effectiveness. All algorithms and software developed in this project will be made available publicly to benefit as many users as possible, whether they are from academe or industry.",

            "abstractText": "Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) have been applied to solve many stationary problems. However, real-world problems are usually more complex and dynamic, where the objective function, decision variables, and environmental parameters may change over time. In this project, we will investigate novel EA approaches to address dynamic optimisation problems (DOPs), a challenging but very important research area. The proposed research has three main aspects: (1) designing and evaluating new EAs for DOPs in collaboration with researchers from Honda Research Institute Europe, (2) theoretically analysing EAs for DOPs, and (3) adapting developed EA approaches to solve dynamic telecommunication optimisation problems. In this project, we will first construct standardised, both discrete and continuous, dynamic test environments based on the concept of problem difficulty, scalability, cyclicity and noise of environments, and standardised performance measures for evaluating EAs for DOPs. Based on the standardised dynamic test and evaluation environment, we will then design and evaluate novel EAs and their hybridisation, e.g., Estimation of Distribution Algorithms (EDAs), Genetic Algorithms, Swarm Intelligence and Adaptive Evolutionary Algorithms, for DOPs based on our previous research. A guiding idea here is to improve EA's adaptability to different degrees of environmental change in the genotypic space, be it binary or not. Systematically and adaptively combining dualism-like schemes for significant changes, random immigration-like schemes for medium changes, and general mutation or variation schemes for small changes, is expected to greatly improve EA's performance in different dynamic environments. And memory schemes can be used when the environment involves cyclic changes. In order to better understand the fundamental issues, theoretical analysis of EAs for DOPs will be pursued in this project. We will apply drift analysis and martingale theory as the starting point to analyse the computational time complexity of EAs for DOPs and the dynamic behaviour of EAs for DOPs regarding such properties as tracking error, tracking velocity, and reliability of arriving at optima. Based on the above EA design, experimental evaluation, and formal analysis, we will then develop a generic framework of EAs for DOPs by extracting key techniques/properties of efficient EAs for DOPs and studying the relationship between them and the characteristics of DOPs being solved with respect to the environmental dynamics in the genotypic space. Another key aspect of this project is to apply and adapt developed EAs for general DOPs to solve core dynamic telecommunications problems, e.g., dynamic frequency assignment problems and dynamic call routing problems, in the real world. We will closely collaborate with researchers from British Telecommunications (BT) to extract domain-specific knowledge and model dynamic telecommunication problems using proper mathematical and graph representations. The obtained domain knowledge will be integrated into our EAs for increased efficiency and effectiveness. All algorithms and software developed in this project will be made available publicly to benefit as many users as possible, whether they are from academe or industry.",

            "abstractText": "Selective hyperheuristics are a set of optimisation techniques that effectively optimise the search algorithm during an optimisation run by selecting combinations of lower level heuristic operations (e.g. mutation, crossover &amp; replication). They operate at the level above metaheuristics (e.g. evolutionary algorithms) and are thus able to react to changes in the search space by modifying the heuristics that are applied to the search problem. Traditional selective hyperheuristics consider single heuristics and heuristic pair performance when determining the heuristic to select next. This project will develop new methods known as a sequence analysis based hyperheuristics (SEQAH) and will investigate the use of sequence analysis techniques, taken from other computational domains such as bioinformatics and natural-language processing, to determine heuristic selection. SEQAH methods will record the search process as a sequence of pairs of heuristic application and performance, and will process this information to inform the selection of the next heuristic to apply in the optimisation. This will allow the technique to automatically select the best heuristics to apply for a given problem - effectively tuning the algorithm to new optimisation problem types, regardless of the underlying application area. By selecting from a set of heuristics, the SEQAH techniques can combine ordinary heuristic operations (e.g. mutation and crossover) with more problem-specific heuristics such as human-designed 'rules-of-thumb' into one coherent algorithm that is able to generate near-optimal solutions in less computational time.\n\nThe developed techniques will be tested on problems from the literature and a suite of real-world problems in water distribution optimisation including the design, rehabilitation and operation of large-scale water systems. The optimisation of these systems has the potential to offer improved services in terms of reliability and water quality and to reduce the future cost and environmental impact of providing clean, safe drinking water to homes across the country. The SEQAH technique also has the potential to extend beyond the water industry and should be applicable to any number of optimisation problems in many application areas due to its ability to adapt to new problem spaces online.",
            "potentialImpact": "Water Distribution Impact\nThe initial impact from this project will be wide-ranging with beneficiaries including our partners, Mouchel Ltd., their clients (large UK water companies) and ultimately the consumers that require the provision of clean, safe drinking water with minimal financial and environmental cost. The effective optimisation of the operation and design of water distribution systems in the UK is having and will have a profound effect on the socio-economic wellbeing of the UK. With an ageing infrastructure, increasing demand and regulation and the pressure exerted by climate change UK water companies are required to optimise their operations as effectively as possible. This will yield reduced bills for customers, will go some way to preserving an increasingly scarce resource and promises to reduce the environmental impact (including carbon emissions) of water supply.\n\nWider Impact\nThe wider impact of the research will be achieved through the expansion of application fields to which the hyperheuristics will be applied. Many companies that currently do not employ optimisation as they do not have the expertise to tune the algorithms will be able to apply this self-tuning technique which can incorporate problem-specific expertise in the form of heuristics. The exploration of the relationship between problem type and optimisation algorithm will provide key information as to the extent to which algorithms must be modified and tuned from one problem type to another. The results from the investigation in water distribution problems will demonstrate the variation in heuristics and their sequencing required to generate good results for a problem type in reasonable computational time. However, towards the end of the project, we fully intend to develop and test the techniques on a wider number of application areas and industry sectors using the contacts from our industrial partner.\n\nBackground\nOptimisation is a key component in delivering efficiency and cost savings to businesses in many sectors and evolutionary optimisation has been shown to provide excellent results within reasonable timeframes in a wide variety of sectors. The investigators for this project have been involved in high-impact research involving industry for a number of years. Dr Keedwell has developed evolutionary algorithms for the optimisation of city-scale water distribution systems [1] and work is ongoing under the auspices of a CASE studentship to improve discolouration risk modelling in UK water companies [2]. Prof. Savic has had significant involvement with industry in the UK and further afield through a large number of EPSRC, UKWIR &amp; FRMRC funded projects including EP/H015736/1 (start May 2010) which names some 14 industrial partners and includes both Prof. Savic (PI) and Dr Keedwell (Co-I) as investigators. This background demonstrates that the investigators have a history of working with business and achieving impact through the use of innovative computing technology and their application to problems in the water industry.\n\n[1] Randall-Smith, M, Rogers C, Keedwell E, Diduch R, Kapelan Z, (2006) &quot;Optimized Design of the City of Ottawa Water Network: a Genetic Algorithm Case Study&quot; 8th Annual Water Distribution Systems Analysis Symposium pp1-20\n[2] McClymont, K., Keedwell,E.

            "abstractText": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) research and the development of the multi-billion dollar video games industry have gone hand in hand for many years. Video games are by far the most prevalent way that the public encounter AI techniques on a day to day basis, and the desire for better video games has driven AI research in areas such as move/path planning, decision making, non-player character (NPC) behaviour and the automated generation of game content. A recent development of Monte Carlo methods called the Upper Confidence Bounds for Trees (UCT) method promises to have a profound impact on AI for games. Applications of UCT are not limited to games and have potential benefits for almost any domain where simulation and statistical modelling can be used to forecast outcomes, such as planning, decision support, economic modelling, behavioural analysis, and so on.Since it appeared in 2006/7, UCT has revolutionised the demanding problem of move planning for computer Go to produce artificial players able to beat professional players for the first time this year, a feat previously thought infeasible. UCT has also been successfully applied to the less specialised domain of General Game Playing (GGP) to produce the 2008 and 2009 world champion GGP programs. This success in Go, where substantial problem-specific knowledge is used, and in GGP, where it is impossible to use problem-specific knowledge, points to the tantalising possibility of the broad use of UCT between these two extremes. Game AI researchers are now starting to take such a great interest in UCT that we are seeing the birth of a new research field of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). However, there has been to date no unified effort to fully understand and exploit the UCT algorithm and related MCTS methods, a state of affairs that we plan to redress.The proposed research will develop and evaluate novel extensions of the UCT method to increase its applicability to a broad range of game-related domains including: its use for move planning and decision making in infinite, continuous real-time environments; its application to situations involving uncertainty and incomplete information; and its application to multi-objective and ensemble planning approaches. We will also investigate its use for more general game-related problems including the detection and optimisation or correction of suboptimal game designs and game content, and the automated generation of new high quality games and game content. Further, we will demonstrate how the techniques we develop can be applied to broader non-game domains by demonstrating their application to robotic control and automated music generation, in particular the creatively challenging task of jazz improvisation.The potential impact of UCT and MCTS cannot be overstated. Landmark events that have driven AI research include the introduction of tree search methods which have been the backstay of AI decision making since the inception of this field in the 1950s, and the formalisation of Monte Carlo methods in the 1970s for simulation-based decision making in a broader range of more general and less well-defined problems. UCT/MCTS promises to be the next major breakthrough in AI methods that combines the power of tree search with the generality of simulation-based search.",
            "potentialImpact": "UCT has revolutionised the world of Computer Go, with computer players based on these techniques playing at a level that was inconceivable only a decade ago. We believe that a similar level of impact can be achieved in a far broader range of game and non-game domains to significantly benefit the multi-billion dollar video games industry and, more generally, AI research into search, optimisation and decision making. The vast majority of UCT research to date has been done outside the UK (largely in France, Canada, and the US). This state of affairs should not be allowed to continue; funding this research will make UCT research more accessible to UK industry. The public have already shown a great appetite for innovation in video games, with UK games studios well known internationally for their pioneering work in AI. UCT could provide a huge fillip to a new generation of video game designers. Better AI is seen by most game studios as being critical to the success of future titles, and there are now many well documented cases of smart AI being a major selling point of a game with titles such as F.E.A.R, Halo 3, Left4Dead and Crysis being prime examples. The best way to achieve effective AI is heavily debated and is dependent on many factors such as the complexity of the problem, the tools available, the skills base within a company, etc. However, for many games, good AI is extremely hard to achieve and is often one of the most disappointing aspects of even AAA game titles with budgets in the tens or hundreds of millions of dollars. UCT has the potential to revolutionise video game AI in the same way that it has revolutionised Computer Go and General Game Playing. It will lead to characters that behave in appropriate ways not because they have been explicitly programmed to do so, but because such behaviour emerges as the optimal response to a given situation through statistical simulation. This is a very general approach that can shape behaviour in all kinds of ways, in order to make it smarter, more stupid, more challenging, more supportive, and so on. Our work should provide tools that help deliver an optimised player experience with relatively little programming effort. In addition to the direct use of UCT to enhance the AI of the in-game characters, equally significant is the use of UCT as a game designer's tool to analyse the quality of the game mechanics. The proposed research has the potential for enormous impact in the UK and worldwide and we aim to fully exploit this.",

This prestigious Summer School is organized biannually by the European Coordination Committee on Artificial Intelligence, each year in a different European country. This is the first time that ACAI is organized in the Britain or Ireland. ACAI'09 will focus on methods and tools available for the development of Intelligent Decision Support Systems. These systems can take decisions by themselves or by interacting and cooperating with humans. As such they have a wide range of important applications in areas like healthcare, finance, emergency response, etc. The Summer School will include courses delivered by distinguished academics and industrial representatives with extensive experience in the development and application of such systems. The courses are designed to be interactive and will consist of a mixture of lectures and hands-on practice.",
            "potentialImpact": "Beneficiaries - UK researchers including PhD students and advanced MSc students Benefits/Impact It provides an opportunity for UK researchers to interact with some of the world leaders in IDSS research. As ACAI'09 will be hosted in the UK, we expect it to attract a larger number of UK researchers, PhD students in particular, than are typically able to attend other summer schools and major international conferences, say in the USA. We hope that this will result in more international collaborations in future years, which will help advance IDSS research in the UK. 2) It provides an opportunity for UK researchers to participate in an assessment of the state of IDSS research and an assessment of their role in shaping the future of IDSS research. This is significant if IDSS research in the UK is to stay at the forefront of this field of study. 3) It provides a unique training opportunity for PhD students. There is a large number of PhD students currently studying in fields related to IDSS in the UK, and we believe that they can benefit from interacting with experts in their PhD subject areas early in their studies. ACAI'09 will enable them to do so in an affordable way (The organising committee of ACAI'09 will endeavour to make the associated PhD forum as affordable as possible by seeking sponsorships for ACAI'09 ). 4) ACAI'09 can also indirectly benefit IDSS related industry in the UK. Today's IDSS research is diverse, and there is a strong feeling within the international IDSS community that one size does not fit all and new IDSS tools are needed. The range of topics covered by the invited speakers at ACAI'09 represents some of the emerging areas where novel products may be developed, and can therefore help inform the industry, through participants and their industrial collaborators, of opportunities for new product development in future years. We are also interested in reinforcing the link between academy an industry therefore we are keen on providing a space for companies using IDSS to participate of this event. SAP, an international company with a branch in Belfast, already signed up to provide a talk on how they use IDSS in their company. We will be contacting other companies using IDSS who wish to share their experience and interact with the participants of ACAI'09.",
